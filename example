🔶 Slide 3: Tech Stack Mastery

> “Practiced the stack to perform confidently”



Tech Stack	Hands-On Work Done

C# / .NET Core	Created APIs using Dapper & EF Core. Integrated Repository Pattern
MS SQL	Wrote optimized stored procedures & handled advanced joins
React + Tailwind + MUI	Developed responsive UI with components, hooks, and prop handling
Authentication	Implemented secure JWT + Identity-based auth, with session handling
Tools & Workflow	Git, Bitbucket, Swagger, Postman, Confluence, Azure DevOps

🔶 Slide 4: Projects Delivered

> “Bridging theory with real contributions”



🔷 Trustee Initiatives Full-Stack App

✅ Built REST APIs (CRUD) using ASP.NET Core + Dapper

✅ Connected to MS SQL DB with stored procedures for:

Trustee Screening

Vestiture Calculations


✅ Pagination, filtering, sorting, dashboard KPIs

✅ Search & regex validation, JWT auth, and frontend display with React


🔷 Bonus: Restaurant App

Practiced UI design, modular components, and routing

Integrated auth flow and CRUD pattern with mock APIs



---

🔶 Slide 5: Teamwork & Agile Integration

> “Not just development, but working as part of a product team”



Participated in Daily Standups, Sprint Planning, Grooming

Tracked stories using JIRA, wrote & reviewed in Confluence

Attended code walkthroughs and demo sessions with mentors

Completed CLFY-25 compliance, domain knowledge sessions

Collaborated cross-functionally: testing, debugging, and peer learning



---

🔶 Slide 6: Technical & Non-Technical Challenges

> “Faced real challenges. Grew with each one.”



⚙️ Technical Challenges

Issue	Resolution

Swagger 500 Errors	Debugged pipeline, fixed middleware order & exception filters
Dapper SQL Mapping	Learned multi-mapping with joins using QueryAsync<T1, T2, TResult>
CORS & Proxy in React/.NET	Applied CORS headers, set up proxy in package.json
JWT Token Flow	Understood token lifecycle, applied refresh logic
Pagination Implementation	Used SQL OFFSET-FETCH & passed meta headers for total count/pages



---

💬 Non-Technical Challenges

Challenge	How I Overcame

Communication in Standups	Prepared questions, took notes, asked follow-ups proactively
Time Management (Internship + Study)	Used calendar blocks, Pomodoro technique to balance learning + delivery
Agile Mindset Shift	Broke large tasks into smaller chunks, shared WIP early
Working with Existing Codebase	Spent time understanding folder structure and domain-specific logic



---

🔶 Slide 7: What’s Next?
