Hereâ€™s the short professional update including those points:


---

Bugs fixed & improvements:

Replaced .map() with .forEach() where return value was not used (to avoid unnecessary array creation).

Replaced .filter() with .find() when only the first matching element was required (more efficient).

Fixed missing/incorrect return statements in functions.

Removed unused variable (backToCopy).

Changed let â†’ const where reassignment not needed (immutability & clarity).

Used strict equality (===, !==) instead of loose (==, !=) to avoid type coercion bugs.

Corrected JSX parsing issues (mismatched tags/brackets).

Resolved Sonar code quality issues (readability, maintainability, performance).

ðŸ‘‰ This is concise, professional, and shows both the issues and why changes were made.

Do you want me to also write a one-liner explanation for each change (why it improves functionality/quality) so you can keep it ready if your manager asks further?
