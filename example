🎓 1-Month Internship Progress Summary

From Foundation to Full-Stack Delivery
By [Your Name]


---

🔹 Slide 1: Starting With Strong Foundations

Week 1 – Building Core Understanding

Learned SOLID Principles to ensure clean, maintainable architecture.

Studied Design Patterns like Singleton, Adapter, Factory.

Practiced basic DSA and algorithm design logic to strengthen problem-solving.

Understood the difference between .NET Framework vs .NET Core.

Installed & configured tools: VS Code, SQL Server, Git, Bitbucket, Postman, Swagger.

Practiced C#, React, and SQL via platforms like Leetcode, GTG, W3Schools, TutorialsPoint.


🧠 Goal: Build a solid programming and system design mindset before jumping into implementation.


---

🔹 Slide 2: Learning the Tech Stack – Theory to Practice

Week 2 – Getting Hands-on

Studied C#, ReactJS, MS SQL, ASP.NET Core, REST APIs.

Practiced SQL:

Subqueries, Joins, Aggregates, Leetcode SQL.

Wrote stored procedures, triggers.


Worked on React hooks, props, state, JSX syntax, folder structure.

Started with ASP.NET MVC, controllers, models, dependency injection.

Practiced building CRUD APIs with Dapper and EF Core.


🛠 Tools: GitHub, Bitbucket, Swagger, SQL Server Management Studio

🔹 Slide 3: Project Implementation Begins

Week 3 – From Practice to Real Projects

✅ Trustee Initiatives Full-Stack App

Built backend APIs using .NET Core + Dapper + MS SQL

Integrated frontend using React, Tailwind, MUI

Implemented JWT, Identity-based authentication

Features: Dashboard, CRUD operations, Pagination, Sorting, Filtering, Regex validations.


✅ Database Work

Wrote and optimized stored procedures:
dbo.PLAN_INFO, Trustee_Plan_Onboarding, AML Screening, Vesting, Forfeiture.


✅ Team Collaboration

Joined DSUs, Sprint Planning sessions.

Worked with teammates to understand task blockers.

Explored .NET & React project structures on GitHub.

🔹 Slide 4: Technical Challenges & How I Solved Them

Challenge	Solution

Swagger returning 500 error	Debugged middleware, added exception handling.
CORS not allowing frontend access	Applied correct CORS policy setup in Startup.cs
Complex SQL stored procedure mapping	Used Dapper.QueryMultiple, verified param types and joins
Authentication logic confusion	Deep-dived into JWT, OAuth flow and Identity user roles
Understanding existing codebase	Traced controller-service-repo flow, added debug breakpoints



---

🔹 Slide 5: Agile Practices & Communication

🌀 Agile-Scrum Learning

Attended DSU, Sprint Planning, Backlog Grooming.

---

🔹 Slide 6: Final Touches & Beyond

✅ Project Finalization

Added:

Client-side and Server-side Pagination

Charts and dashboards for data visualization

Email/password Regex for form validation


Built a second app (Restaurant App) to reinforce learning.


📈 Continued Learning

Practiced reusable components

Revised Design Patterns, Algorithms, and SOLID principles



---

🔹 Slide 7: What’s Next?

🎯 Immediate Goals

Improve Unit Testing skills using xUnit

Build more reusable architecture using patterns like Factory/Repository

Explore CI/CD, Docker, and Microservices basics

Continue building full-stack projects to strengthen grip over system design.
